# ⏱️ Debounce vs Throttle (JavaScript)

Both **debounce** and **throttle** are techniques used to **limit how often a function runs**, especially when dealing with events that fire frequently (like scroll, resize, keypress, etc).

---

# ✅ Debounce

### 🔹 Definition
Debounce ensures a function is **only called after a certain amount of time has passed since the last event**.

### 🔑 Key Idea
> **Wait until the user stops performing the action.**

### 📌 Use cases
- Search input (API call after typing stops)
- Auto-save after typing stops
- Form validation

### 🧠 Behavior
- If the event keeps firing, the timer keeps resetting
- Function runs **only once**, after the events stop

### ⚙️ Example
```js
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}



# ⏳ Throttle (JavaScript)

## ✅ Definition
Throttle ensures a function is **only called at most once every fixed interval**, regardless of how many times the event fires.

## 🔑 Key Idea
> **Run the function at regular intervals.**

## 📌 Use Cases
- Scroll event (update UI every 100ms)
- Window resize (calculate layout periodically)
- Button click prevention (rate limiting)
- API rate limiting

## 🧠 Behavior
- Executes immediately (depending on implementation)
- Blocks subsequent calls until the interval passes
- Ensures **consistent execution rate**

## ⚙️ Example (Basic)
```js
function throttle(fn, delay) {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return function (...args) {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= delay) {
      lastCall = now;
      fn.apply(this, args);
    }
  };
}
```

## 🔍 Notes
- If the event keeps firing, the function runs **once per interval**.
- Throttle is ideal when you want **continuous but limited updates**.

## 🧠 Quick Comparison (with Debounce)
| Feature | Throttle | Debounce |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Runs at regular intervals? | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Runs after events stop? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Best for | Scroll, resize | Search input |
| Execution pattern | Multiple executions | Single execution |
